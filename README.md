This application is an application that reads data from a kafka topic and process it before storing it into a new topic named "user-login-processed"

1. How would you deploy this application in production?
    i. Infrastructure: Set up a production-grade infrastructure with sufficient resources (CPU, memory, storage) to handle the expected data load. Consider using cloud services like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud for scalability and availability.
    ii. High Availability: Deploy Kafka and Zookeeper clusters in a highly available configuration to ensure data durability and fault tolerance. Use multiple Kafka brokers and Zookeeper nodes.

    iii. Monitoring: Implement monitoring and alerting solutions (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) to track the health of Kafka clusters, consumer lag, resource usage, and system metrics. Set up alerts for critical issues.
    iv. Logging: Configure centralized logging (e.g., ELK stack) to collect and analyze logs generated by your application and Kafka.

    v. Security: Implement robust security measures, including SSL/TLS encryption, authentication, and authorization, to protect your Kafka clusters and data.
    vi. Deployment Automation: Use container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes for managing the application's containers and scaling up/down as needed.
    vii. Scaling: Ensure the Kafka consumer application can scale horizontally by adding more consumer instances as data volume increases.
    viii. Backup and Recovery: Implement backup and recovery strategies for your Kafka data, in case of data loss or cluster failures. For example, we can use Amazon MSK Connect Sink Connector to backup data into Amazon S3 and recover from it if we need it.
    
    iv. Deployment Strategies: Use deployment strategies like Canary deployments to minimize downtime during updates or changes to your application. This way, we can ensure the pipeline is stable and ready before scaling it up to fully productive.

2. What other components would you want to add to make this production-ready?

3. How can this application scale with a growing dataset?

*To run this application in your local machine, please follow steps below:*
1. Pull all the files (except myenv if you are not tring to run the python script separately) into your machine.
2. Install Docker
3. In your terminal, type "docker compose up --build" and it should start running
4. Double confirm by checking the terminal messages and see if the .py script has produced success messages.
